# Penngram

This is the new version of a project I worked on my junior year of high school. I am currenlty focused on the backend infrastucre which I will be using node and deploying on Heroku. Some alterations of this version of the app involve verfying student emails by using an [API](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list) to detect the domain name and Mailgun to send the email. I think I am at around 10% of the code I used to build the first version of this app and I would say I am around 75% done.
